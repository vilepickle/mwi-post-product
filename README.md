# Magento Wordpress Integration: Post Product Selection

## Quickly add a Magento product to the end of your post/page

This Wordpress plugin integrates with the Magento Wordpress Integration plugin and requires the mwi-shortcodes-widgets plugin as well.

Get both of those plugins at http://www.mwi-plugin.com/

## Installation

Put the mwi-post-product folder in your wp-content/plugins folder.  Assuming you have Magento Wordpress Integration and its shortcode plugin installed and functioning, your add/edit post administrator page should have a "Select Product" box under your post.  If a product is enabled, the shortcode will automatically be inserted after your post and display a product.

Why is this useful?  Sometimes blog authors forget to add a product to their posts, and this plugin makes it extremely easy to find a product and to add it at the end of a post.
